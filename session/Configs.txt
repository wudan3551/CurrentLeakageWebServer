--- enable session on start of request ---
$vim /etc/php.ini
find session.auto_start and set it to 1
$service php-fpm restart

or alternatively , we can leave php.ini unchanged , but we add
session_start(), for each php script that will use session , this seems more
efficient

--- change group of session file ---
the default session location is /var/lib/php/session/
the default group of this folder is "apache" , damn it !!
$chgrp nginx session
